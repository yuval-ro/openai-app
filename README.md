# About

This is a toy app submitted as a final product for a web-development course.

It provides a "chatting" experience with the text-davinci-003 langauge model using OpenAI's [public API]([https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)).

Every such correspondance is saved as a log document in the noSQL database.
